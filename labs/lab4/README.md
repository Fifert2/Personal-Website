IIT
In this lab I was tasked to,

Create a news feed on my website using a .xml file. We were instructed to do this via a "rss.xml" and "atom.xml" feed. Adding 5 links to artciles of our personal interest. As well as adding some basic style elements so the content could be view easily.
I used the templates and elemnts that were provided in the lab instructions and the w3 schools css websites. I used these public and approved resources to add style elemnts to my website.

Note: I initally had trouble getting my pages to validate and getting the rss.css style to work correctly. So I used chatgpt to assist in the areas that I had trouble completing. I also used chatgpt to find and provde me a rss.css template that displays the style for both the rss and atom feeds.
