This Lab was about creating a resume using HTML and CSS to learn how to set up HTML and organize/ format it using CSS.
The resume will be able to be formated/ displayed on our personal websites.

I had to use the website "W3Schools" for assistance in adding my "headshot picture" as well as formating that picture to my liking. 
I also used it for enbeding a link into my resume.html file that leads to linkedin.
