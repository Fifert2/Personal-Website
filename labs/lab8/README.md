In this lab I was tasked to,

create a .json file and make my lab 3 interface dynamic by using the .json to read the data from my lab pages and then dispaly them on a newly created html.

.json - I used only 3 elements in my menuitem. these 3 elements were easy for me to use and implament the releant information that was needed for it to be read and dispalyed.

JQuery UI - I added a button to go back to the original projects page
