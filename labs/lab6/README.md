IIT
In this lab I was tasked to,

use javascript and edit an interactable page to change certain values and elemnts so they can be displayed to the user differently.
We were intoduced to jQuery and used elements of jQuery in our approach to solving the soltutions.


Bonus:
Problem: 
This line/ script "<script type="text/javascript" src="lab6.js"></script>"

is put into the header and not outside of the header which means that it is loaded before the DOM even exists. Which is a probelm cause it can cause laoding errors.
