IIT
In this Lab we are creating our personal websites and working on indivisualising our websites by makes differnt pages that repsresnt our work from class for 3 purposes.
1. To learn how to use this technology
2. To get a grade
3. To have something to show to potential employers.

I used the templates and elemnts that were provided in the lab instructions and the w3 schools css websites. I used these public and approved resources to add style elemnts to my website.

I aswell made changes to my initial IA plan(layout)
It went iit/labs/lab1/lab2/lab3

the iit held my homepage index.html
and my labs folder that held all other aspects of my website. 

the labs.html is my projects page and lab1,2,3.
What I ended up doing was creating a function about.html but decided to not include it in thee submission of this lab as it is currently redundant and doesnt add anything differnt to my website as of right now. but may become implamented in the future.
